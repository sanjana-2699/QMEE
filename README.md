# Changes in citrate synthase (CS) activity in _Nematostella vectensis_ in response to different acclimation conditions

## Background: 
Starlet sea anemones (_Nematostella vectensis_) are cnidarians endemic to estuarine environments along the Atlantic coast of North America. Across this broad latitudinal range, natural growth habitats vary drastically, particularly in terms of temperature, salinity, reactive oxidative species (ROS), and pollution. Using anemones collected from New Hampshire, USA, we aimed to explore interactions between thermal and saline stress, to determine their capacity for plasticity, and identify underlying signaling pathways. We acclimated anemones using a two-factor design — warm and cold treatments at 16°C or 24°C, and high and low salinity treatments at 30‰ or 15‰ ASW. Leveraging the clonal nature of these anemones, 4 clones from 8 genotypes were used for the 4 treatment groups (i.e., genotype represents a random effect). After an acclimation period of 2 weeks, routine metabolic rates (RMRs), enzyme activities of citrate synthase (CS), and ATPases including Na+-K+ ATPase (NKA), along with markers of ROS damage were measured acutely - both at their acclimation temperature, and at the orthogonal temperature. This particular dataset includes measures of CS activity from this experiment. CS is a commonly used marker of mitochondrial content and is sensitive to changes in both temperature and salinity. This study aims to understand how CS activity is regulated in response to thermal and saline stress.

## Data description: 
The data includes columns on the acclimation and test conditions for each data point - acclimation temperature ('AT') in degrees Celcius, acclimation salinity ('AS'), in parts   per thousand (ppt), and test temperature ('TT') in degrees Celcius. 

The column 'genotype' serves as an ID for which genotype the data point was collected from.

The column 'BSA' refers to the protein content in the sample used, expressed in mg/mL. Protein content was estimated using the Bradford Assay. The final CS activity is standardised using the protein content.

The column 'mass' is the mass of tissue used in the CS assay in mg. This data is included only to provide context for the CS values and is not used for calculations.

Finally, the column 'CS_activity' refers to the CS activity measured using the protocol outlined in (Moyes et al., 1997). The values are in umol citrate/min/mg protein.

Note: The CS activity measures are in triplicates, so there are three separate values for the same genotype in each acclimation group at each test temperature.
